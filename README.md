# example_roulette
Program to refactor that plays a game of roulette

# Discussion:
Added Bet heirarchy.
Then changed the Game class by removing the betIsMade() method and simplifying the play() method. Lastly we changed the Gambler class to deal with its own money after the game is played. We discussed this last change, as we were slightly against adding code to the Gambler, however, we decided it kept the code much cleaner.
