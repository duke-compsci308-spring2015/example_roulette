Program to refactor that plays a game of roulette

1) betIsMade and placeBet
2) Method's that access the Bet abstract class to place the bets and check if 
a bet was made.
3) The different "isMade" and "place" methods should be  in the subclasses.
4) It should access the array at the top but create bets specific to the 
right subclasses.

1) The refactored code is easier to read than the original one. There is no
structure of if statements. Now it is easier to add an additional kind of Bet.
2) It is more complex in that there are additional classes added.
3) One trade-off is that it was necessary to create additional classes. Another
is that we had to put in the time to refactor it.
4) I prefer the refactored version because it is easier to read.
