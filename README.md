Program to refactor that plays a game of roulette

1. The refactored code is simpler because you call the same method and get rid of the if statements by making the Bet class a super class and extending it for each type of bet.
2. The refactored code is more complex because there are more classes and each subclass has to implement methods.
3. We decided to have more, simple classes rather than less, more complex classes.
4. We prefer the refactored code because it's simpler overall and more readable.
