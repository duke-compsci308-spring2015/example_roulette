# example_roulette
Program to refactor that plays a game of roulette
Jeannie Chung/Kevin Chang

We took the if statements from Game and refactored them in separate classes implementing inheritance. This allows us to call any different bet with just a single line. We checked the bets with the same implementations of the original game. We were also able to add a High/Low option using class inheritance.
